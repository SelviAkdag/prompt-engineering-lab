    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive notebook on **Text Classification with Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  \n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore how LLMs can be guided using **different prompting techniques** – such as *zero-shot*, *few-shot*, and *chain-of-thought (CoT)* – to perform classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses **Ollama** (local model) or **OpenAI API** for inference.  \n",
    "Make sure you've completed the setup in `index.html` before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current configuration:**\n",
    "- Backend: `ollama` (or `openai` if configured)\n",
    "- Model: `llama3.2-long` (Ollama) or `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors, verify that:\n",
    "- Ollama is running: `ollama list` should show `llama3.2-long`\n",
    "- `.env` file is configured correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Throughout this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the **core concepts** behind each prompting method.\n",
    "- Experiment with **real examples**.\n",
    "- Test your understanding through **interactive quizzes**.\n",
    "- Receive hints and feedback along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note about the code cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a clean architecture pattern where **all implementation details are kept in separate modules** under the `src/` folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're curious about how things work under the hood:**\n",
    "- **Prompting logic** (how prompts are built): `src/prompting.py`\n",
    "- **LLM calls** (API communication): `src/llm.py`\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics** (accuracy, precision, recall, F1): `src/metrics.py`\n",
    "- **Interactive widgets & visualizations**: `src/notebook_helpers.py`\n",
    "- **Progress tracking**: `src/progress.py`\n",
    "- **Quiz answers & feedback**: `src/quiz_answers.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This design keeps the notebook **focused on learning**, not implementation details. You can always explore the source files if you want to understand or modify the underlying code! 🔍\n"
